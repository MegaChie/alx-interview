    Returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n

        - base: Holds the first and second row's elements
                of the Pascal's Triangle.
        - n: The numbers of rows from Pascal's Triangle.
        - num: Short for number, iteration variable used to hold
               the current row we are calculating.
        - row: Represents the row final value from the triangle.
        - elem: Short for element, iteration variable holding
                the number of propabilities for the current raw.
        - temp: temporary list of lists to
                start calculating the rest of the inner lists.
